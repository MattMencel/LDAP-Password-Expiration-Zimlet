This is a zimlet which works against a Sun ONE LDAP server.  It checks to see if the users password is expired and will prompt them to change it if it's within 14 days of expiration.  It's pretty customized for our site, but it should be pretty clear what you need to change to get it to work at your site.

The commons-lang-2.5.jar library (http://commons.apache.org/downloads/download_lang.cgi) should deploy automatically if it is zipped up in the zimlet.

- ldap.properties
This currently doesn't work.  I want to break the site customized variables out of the ldap.jsp file.  If anyone knows how to pull all the config items in ldap.jsp (bind_dn, search_attr, etc...) out into a config file of some kind, please let me know.  I've tried using a .properties files and can't seem to get it to work in the JSP.

If there is anything you need clarified in this README let me know.

If you make modifications/improvements please share them back.
