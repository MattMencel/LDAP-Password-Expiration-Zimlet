The commons-lang-2.5.jar library (http://commons.apache.org/downloads/download_lang.cgi) should deploy automatically if it is zipped up in the zimlet.

If anyone knows how to pull all the config items in ldap.jsp (bind_dn, search_attr, etc...) out into a config file of some kind, please let me know.  I've tried using .properties files and can't seem to get them to work in the JSP.

If there is anything you need clarified in this README let me know.
